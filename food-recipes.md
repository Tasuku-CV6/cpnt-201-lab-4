## Desserts

### Chocolate Chip Cookies

Ingredients:

- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 3/4 cup white sugar
- 3/4 cup brown sugar
- 5 eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 4 cups semisweet chocolate chips

### Banana Pudding

- Ingredients:
- 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1/2 cup flour
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 6 cups whole milk
- 6 egg yolks
- 3 eggs
- 1/2 cup butter
- 3 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 9 ripe bananas
- 2 (12 ounce) boxes vanilla wafers
- 6 egg whites (see “Test Kitchen Tip”)
- 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar

Instructions:

1. Stir together 1 cup sugar, the flour, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk in milk, egg yolks, and whole eggs until well combined and smooth.
2. Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Pour milk mixture into saucepan with butter; reduce heat to medium-low and whisk constantly until the mixture has thickened, coats the back of a spoon nicely, and begins to bubble, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 2 teaspoons vanilla. Cover and let custard cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. (It will continue to thicken as it cools.)
3. Peel and slice bananas. Line the bottom and sides of 2 (9x13-inch) broiler-safe casserole dishes with vanilla wafers. Layer banana slices over wafers. Pour cooled custard over bananas and wafers, smoothing top with a knife or spatula.
4. For meringue, in a large clean bowl, using an electric mixer or a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat egg whites, cream of tartar, and the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla at high speed until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Spoon meringue over top of custard, covering it completely.
5. Set oven rack about 4 inches from broiler; turn broiler to high. Quickly broil meringues until browned, about 1 to 2 minutes. (This happens very quickly, so keep a close eye on it.)
6. Remove dishes from oven, allow meringue to cool slightly, about 15 minutes, and serve. (Chill, covered, up to 4 days.)

Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.
3. Cream together butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until smooth.
4. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla.
5. Gradually blend in the dry ingredients.
6. Stir in chocolate chips.
7. Drop tablespoon-sized balls of dough onto ungreased baking sheets.
8. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until golden brown.
9. Cool on wire racks.
